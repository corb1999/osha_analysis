Explanatory Notes
- Scope of the data: OSHA only collects data from a portion of all private sector establishments in the United States. Therefore, this data is not representative of all businesses and general conclusions pertaining to all U.S. business should not be drawn.
- Data quality: While OSHA takes multiple steps to ensure the data collected is accurate, problems and errors invariably exist for a small percentage of establishments. OSHA does not believe the data for the establishments with the highest rates in these files are accurate in absolute terms. Efforts are made during the collection cycle to correct submission errors; however, some remain unresolved. It would be a mistake to say establishments with the highest rates in these files are the "most dangerous" or "worst" establishments in the nation.
- Rate Calculation: An incidence rate of injuries and illnesses is computed from the following formula: (Number of injuries and illnesses x 200,000) / Employee hours worked = Incidence rate. The TCR includes all cases recorded on the OSHA Form 300 (Column H + Column I + Column J). The DART includes cases recorded in Column H + Column I.
